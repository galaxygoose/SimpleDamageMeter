# SimpleDamageMeter

SimpleDamageMeter is a World of Warcraft addon designed to provide a lightweight and straightforward display of damage output during encounters. It tracks the damage done by players and their pets, providing immediate feedback on performance in dungeons, raids, and other PVE content.

## Features

- Tracks and displays total damage and DPS (damage per second) for the player.
- Captures all direct damage, damage over time (DoTs), and pet damage.
- Simple in-game command to display damage statistics.

## Installation

To install SimpleDamageMeter:

1. Download the addon from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleDamageMeter/releases) page.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Copy the `SimpleDamageMeter` folder into your `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns` directory.
4. Restart World of Warcraft or use the `/reload` command if the game is running.

## Usage

SimpleDamageMeter runs automatically when you enter combat. To share your damage statistics, type `/sdmg` in the chat window. This will display your total damage and DPS for the most recent combat encounter.

## Configuration

SimpleDamageMeter is designed to be plug-and-play with no configuration needed. However, future versions may include customizable options accessible through an in-game interface.
